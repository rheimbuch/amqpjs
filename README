AMQP-JS
-----------

AMQP-JS is a thin javascript wrapper around the rabbitmq java client. It's a first pass, so 
expect bugs. Currently it is only supports exchange/queue creation and publishing. It's also
only been tested against RabbitMQ; no idea if works against other AMQP servers.

Requirements
------------

- Rhino Javascript runtime
- RabbitMQ instance

Example
-----------

	AMQP = require('AMQP.js');
	var amqp = new AMQP({hostname:'localhost'});
	var topicExch = amqp.topic({name:'myExchange'});
	var queue = amqp.queue('myQueue');
	queue.bind({exchange:'myExchange', key:'nested.key'});
	topicExch.publish({key:'nested.key', body:'Hello from Rhino!'});
